# Simple PokeAPI
<p>Simplified copy of the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. This copy is to be used by programming students first learning about API's.</p>

<p>Documentation can be found <a href="https://jacobtheevans.github.io/simple-pokeapi-docs/#/">here</a></p>

## Whats inside
<p>Inside you will find two folders. The first 'api-bot' folder is a Python bot that scrapes the PokeAPI database and then formats the data. This requires a imgurAPI key as it uploads the sprite images to imgur.com The second 'server' folder is a express server that serves up the new API copy.</p>

## Credit
<p>All data is taken from the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a> and all credit goes to  <a href="https://twitter.com/phalt_">Paul Hallett</a> and the other developers behind PokeAPI.</p>
